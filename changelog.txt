Removed Uranium and platinum from Earthlike because vanilla did that.
Thanks to Külmking

2019-09-11 -- 7.0.3c (SE 1.192 - Economy Update)

Updated to add ore values to be compatible with economics
Added frequency settings that should make the more common (usu. iron-based or lower-tiered) ores more common

2019-05-25 -- 7.0.3b (SE 1.190.1):

I found out that "Solids" and "CommonMetals" were merged in an earlier update, thus they are all CMs now. In other words, 4 tiers of ores became 3. (Thanks, Deadok!)

As a result, the following ores should now process in the basic refinery:
Hapkeite
Dolomite
Sinoite
Olivine
Quartz
Akimotoite
Wadsleyite

Rebalancing Tweak:
Dolomite contains 75% more magnesium.

2019-05-19 -- 7.0.3 (SE 1.190.1):

In response to lack of asteroid cores, rarer space ores, increased resources for vanilla stone, I have made the following tweaks to make mining tier 1 ores a little more worthwhile.

Rebalancing Tweaks:
Restored Icy Iron ore-spawn-per-volume-mined to default settings (formerly reduced when asteroid cores had so much of it)
Icy Iron contains 10% more ice & iron
Dense iron contains 5% more iron
Hapkeite contains 25% more silicon
Cohenite contains 60% more nickel
Cohenite contains 50% more cobalt
Kamacite contains 20% more iron
Kamacite contains 30% more nickel
Kamacite contains 20% more cobalt
Sinoite contains 40% more silicon
(Ice) Sinoite contains 100% more ice
Olivine contains 50% more silicon
Olivine contains 30% more magnesium
(Ice) Olivine contains 100% more ice
Heazelwoodite contains 30% more nickel
(Ice) Heazelwoodite injected with ice (0.15 kg ice/kg ore, compared to 0.9 in vanilla ice)
Quartz contains 20% more silicon
(Ice) Quartz contains 100% more ice (it's now icier than ice)
Quartz processes 30% slower (counterbalance, it has a lot of ice, now)
Akimotoite contains 10% more silicon
Akimotoite contains 100% more magnesium
(Ice) Wadsleyite injected with ice (0.25 kg ice/kg ore)

2018-03-06 -- 7.0.2b (SE 1.189.040):

Synced mod to planet updates:
	synced wildlife spawn data
	synced specular data
	synced MieColorScattering whatever that is
	synced updated gravities
	synced Europa has ice instead of stone
	synced Mars had its atmosphere completely changed
	synced remove biomes cause I guess they decided no biomes
	synced a few other microchanges

Synced new physical object data:
	synced physic material
	added physic material to mod ores

Removed icy stone
	- probably should have been removed when planets came out
	- now totally outdated by new vanilla stone output
'Cleaned' gravel byproduct out of ore
	- hasn't been relevant for a long time
	- now totally outdated by new vanilla stone output

? Contemplating removing icy iron/dense iron
	- vanilla regular iron now has a % chance to autoconvert to something else
? Contemplating removing backwards compatibility with 1+ year old versions of game data
	- this would clean up mod data


2018-03-02 -- 7.0.2a (SE 1.189.040):

Hotfix: Wind generators work again.
Due to survival update and a need to redesign a few base aspects of this mod, removed ALL planetary data until determined to what extent this mod will modify plantary data in future.


2018-10-01 -- 7.0.1 (SE 1.187.209):

  Hotfix: Fixed plain iron game crash.


2018-10-01 -- 7.0.0 (SE 1.187.2):

 v7.0 Major features:
 - Planet ores located (earthlikes=easy) 5x deeper / (everything else) 10x deeper!
 - Planet ore veins 10x richer!
 - Elements in the names!

 Minor Updates:
 - Vanilla asteroid stone now uses vanilla stone skin
 - Optimized long distance viewing of mod voxels
 - Added new/missing stones to planet ores
 
 Sync-With-Game-Updates:
 - Gravity was increased
 - Voxel landing particles
 - Planet mesher postprocessing
 - Planet far layers
 - Planet cloud layers

 Compatibility enhancement:
 - Dense Ores mod should no longer break this game's denes iron ore when you put it above this one on the mod list
 - RUS version can be upgraded to this mod without breaking
 - All other versions can be upgraded to this mod without breaking

 Planned features:
 - Waiting for feedback from Keen for localization purposes, planning on RUS and CN localization first
 - Строящаяся российская локализация
 - 中文本地化到时候可以发布，等Keen让模组能使用本地化技术


2017-09-22 -- 6.9.2 (SE 1.186.4):
- UPDATE: ore dark spots use new code (from 1.186.1; broken in 1.186.0) (thanks Darkfire)
(Note: In vanilla, Mars and the moon don't have dark spots, so they don't here either.)


2017-09-22 -- 6.9.1 (SE 1.184.1):
- BUGFIX: Fixed two typos (thanks Tanis)
- BUGFIX: Green textures less grassy (thanks melelconquistador)


2017-08-21 -- 6.90 (SE 1.183.0):
Thanks to everyone for your patience and testing.
- CHANGE: Completely rebalanced ore distributions
- NEW: 2 new ores, Petzite and Uraniaurite
- BUGFIX: Voxel hand now properly shows preview again
- EXTRA: Compatibility Patch for Doctor Octoganapus's dense ores


6.86b (SE 1.180.5):
Thanks to @jb_aero
- Fixed typo causing dolomite to not load in planets.


6.86 (SE01.179.1 Minor):
- Icons fixed so that they don't have the blue backgrounds (since 1.179)


6.85:
Thanks to @Neitronus:
- Textures broken (yay purple!) by update, massive revamp:
- Textures now use the planetary resources so textures are way better.


6.84:
Mod-unrelated planetary changes updated in the mod's overwrite file.
- Cyberhounds are now wolves
- More stones should have other elements in them
- The atmospheres of planets should have the recent graphic updates


6.8:
- Added particle effects to all the new textures.
- Added FATSACK planet definitions for BS stone generation for Earthlikes.
- Applied G.E.W.P Wolfiy's application of custom ores to all the other planets.
- Updated said file changes to the "atmospheric music" patch.
- Fixed some typos.
- File to mod surface stones found, but no good results yet, more later!
