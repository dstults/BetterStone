2024-04-06 -- v7.0.12 (SE 1.203.630 Anniversary Update)

Replace the sky textures back in for Triton and Pertam

2023-04-17 -- v7.0.11 (SE 1.202.066 Automation Update)

Rebalance to match vanilla changes -
- Less gold, slightly less silver and uranium
- More cobalt, platinum

Patch additions -
- Compatibility Patch with Industrial Overhaul
- You can now crush and purify ores added by Better Stone

2022-04-01 v7.0.10

Blueprints now use their ore icons for their corresponding recipes

2021-04-25 -- 7.0.9 (SE 1.198.024)

Added barebones compatibility with Industrial Overhaul mod

2021-01-26 -- 7.0.8 (SE 1.197.xxx)

Thanks @ Exilierator: Added a couple missing uraniaurite voxel definitions

2020-12-17 -- 7.0.7 (SE 1.197.072)

Added Better Stone for Pertam - new desert planet
Added Better Stone for Triton - DLC ice planet
Merged vanilla "difficulty" (GUI thing that was added recently)
Added dozens of arbitrary spaces to match changes in vanilla files
Added colored icon for vanilla iron when it appears in trade stations
Updated thumbnail to reflect update to major patch, yay!

2020-08-10 -- 7.0.6 (SE 1.196) by kynalvarus

Merged new dynamic weather changes from vanilla

Micro changes by DranKof:
Thumbnail update to reflect update to major SE patch
The last two updates were erroneously written as 7.9.x instead of 7.0.x.

2020-02-22 -- 7.0.3f (SE 1.193.1)

Removed old DiffuseXZ and NormalXZ entries from iron_01 and petzite accidentally leftover from a past overhaul

2020-01-28 -- 7.0.3e (SE 1.193)

Akimotoite was missing <MinimalPricePerUnit> et al, fixed. (Thanks Mattheus)
Earthlike planet ores spawn at 1x the default depths, yet still 5x the richness (depth after appearing).
I did this so that I wouldn't have messages literally once every two weeks saying "it doesn't work" or "I can't find gold", etc.
If you want more challenge, all the other planet ore depths remain at 10x the depth, 10x the richness.
 ---> Other changes:
Preview pics said a reload wasn't needed but one is needed now, so those are removed.
Updated included ore records and provided links in mod description


2019-12-17 -- 7.0.3d (SE 1.193)

Removed Uranium and platinum from Earthlike because vanilla did that.
Thanks to Külmking

2019-09-11 -- 7.0.3c (SE 1.192 - Economy Update)

Updated to add ore values to be compatible with economics
Added frequency settings that should make the more common (usu. iron-based or lower-tiered) ores more common

2019-05-25 -- 7.0.3b (SE 1.190.1):

I found out that "Solids" and "CommonMetals" were merged in an earlier update, thus they are all CMs now. In other words, 4 tiers of ores became 3. (Thanks, Deadok!)

As a result, the following ores should now process in the basic refinery:
Hapkeite
Dolomite
Sinoite
Olivine
Quartz
Akimotoite
Wadsleyite

Rebalancing Tweak:
Dolomite contains 75% more magnesium.

2019-05-19 -- 7.0.3 (SE 1.190.1):

In response to lack of asteroid cores, rarer space ores, increased resources for vanilla stone, I have made the following tweaks to make mining tier 1 ores a little more worthwhile.

Rebalancing Tweaks:
Restored Icy Iron ore-spawn-per-volume-mined to default settings (formerly reduced when asteroid cores had so much of it)
Icy Iron contains 10% more ice & iron
Dense iron contains 5% more iron
Hapkeite contains 25% more silicon
Cohenite contains 60% more nickel
Cohenite contains 50% more cobalt
Kamacite contains 20% more iron
Kamacite contains 30% more nickel
Kamacite contains 20% more cobalt
Sinoite contains 40% more silicon
(Ice) Sinoite contains 100% more ice
Olivine contains 50% more silicon
Olivine contains 30% more magnesium
(Ice) Olivine contains 100% more ice
Heazelwoodite contains 30% more nickel
(Ice) Heazelwoodite injected with ice (0.15 kg ice/kg ore, compared to 0.9 in vanilla ice)
Quartz contains 20% more silicon
(Ice) Quartz contains 100% more ice (it's now icier than ice)
Quartz processes 30% slower (counterbalance, it has a lot of ice, now)
Akimotoite contains 10% more silicon
Akimotoite contains 100% more magnesium
(Ice) Wadsleyite injected with ice (0.25 kg ice/kg ore)

2018-03-06 -- 7.0.2b (SE 1.189.040):

Synced mod to planet updates:
	synced wildlife spawn data
	synced specular data
	synced MieColorScattering whatever that is
	synced updated gravities
	synced Europa has ice instead of stone
	synced Mars had its atmosphere completely changed
	synced remove biomes cause I guess they decided no biomes
	synced a few other microchanges

Synced new physical object data:
	synced physic material
	added physic material to mod ores

Removed icy stone
	- probably should have been removed when planets came out
	- now totally outdated by new vanilla stone output
'Cleaned' gravel byproduct out of ore
	- hasn't been relevant for a long time
	- now totally outdated by new vanilla stone output

? Contemplating removing icy iron/dense iron
	- vanilla regular iron now has a % chance to autoconvert to something else
? Contemplating removing backwards compatibility with 1+ year old versions of game data
	- this would clean up mod data


2018-03-02 -- 7.0.2a (SE 1.189.040):

Hotfix: Wind generators work again.
Due to survival update and a need to redesign a few base aspects of this mod, removed ALL planetary data until determined to what extent this mod will modify plantary data in future.


2018-10-01 -- 7.0.1 (SE 1.187.209):

2017-09-22 -- 6.9.2 (SE 1.186.4):
- UPDATE: ore dark spots use new code (from 1.186.1; broken in 1.186.0) (thanks Darkfire)
(Note: In vanilla, Mars and the moon don't have dark spots, so they don't here either.)


2017-09-22 -- 6.9.1 (SE 1.184.1):
